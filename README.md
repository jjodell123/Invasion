# Invasion/MCA4

Invasion is a first person shooter game where the player is equipped with a bow and various types of arrows, and must use them to defeat multiple rounds of enemies. The enemies have their own AI and animations for attacking, patrolling, and searching for the player. I specifically implemented projectile, explosion, and freeze physics to make interesting projectiles, such as an arrow that explodes barrels and an arrow that freezes enemies for the player to make a quick getaway.

This is an improved version of MCA3. It adds a freeze arrow, better NPC movement, an improved level, and better control for the player.

The game is playable at https://jjodell123.github.io/Invasion/

How to play:
Maneavuer around the map while avoiding enemies. Use the keys 1, 2, and 3 to change your projectile type. The basic arrow deals damage to the monsters, but the knights are immune and can only be damaged when the bomb arrow blows up a barrel. The freeze arrow can be used to slow down a few enemies and allow yourself to escape a dangerous location. To beat a level, you need to defeat all the enemies.
